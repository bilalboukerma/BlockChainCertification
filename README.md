## Sample Project Blockchain Critificate

##Blockchain
Blockchain as the name suggests is a series of blocks. Each block is made of two partsâ€”data and data fragmentation, so we can verify that the data is not modified. To connect the blocks together, there is an earlier block segmentation listed in the data pane. That is, each part of the hash also disturbs the fragmentation of a previous block, which frequently leads to the first mass. In this way, blocks make a series where each segmentation is effectively responsible for all previous segmentation, and then the entire series can be verified. See the diagram below for the illustrated example.

# Bypass the verification

By Using DB Browser
We change the name of the Recipient and when the program runs, we'll notice the loss of verification.
