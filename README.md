## Blockchain

Blockchain as the name suggests is a chain of blocks. Each block is made of two parts – awarde data and a hash of the data, so we could verify the data hasn’t been modified. To connect blocks together, there is a hash of a previous block included into the data part. Meaning, each hash part also hashes a hash of a previous block, which recursively leads to the first block. This way blocks make a chain where effectively each hash is responsible for all the previous hashes, hence the whole chain can be verified.
See the diagram below for the illustrated example.

# Bypass the verification

By Using DB Browser
We change the name of the Recipient and when the program runs, we'll notice the loss of verification.
